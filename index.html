        <p>Robert Frost was born in San Francisco on March 26, 1874.
            While still a young boy, Frost's father died and the family moved to
            Massachusetts. Frost attended Dartmouth College for less than a semester,
            after which he moved back to Massachusetts to teach and work as a reporter
            for a local newspaper. Frost returned to college in 1897 to attend Harvard,
            but he did not graduate. Frost was essentially a self-educated man.
        </p>

        <p>After Harvard, Frost married and sold the farm he had inherited. With
            the proceeds of the sale, he moved his family to England, where he wrote for
            ten years without success. His first works were published by a
            London publisher in 1913.
        </p>

        <p>Frost's works, once printed, met immediate acclaim. His collection of
            poems <i>A Further Range</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. Though he is
            sometimes cast as a pastoral poet, Frost was also a fierce intellectual with
            a decidedly dark view of himself and the world. Frost would use rural
            settings as a metaphor for his philosophical views. Robert Frost is one of
            the best-known and most beloved of American poets. He died in Boston on
            January 29, 1963.

Insert a embed element, for the browsers that don't support HTML5 audio but do support plug-ins. Within the embed element it will sorce the rnt_fireice.mp3 with a width of 250 pixels and a height of 50 pixels and diplays controls, but do not start the video automatically. Also, within the embed the controler, autoplay, showcontrols, and autostart will be set to yes, too allow it to be used across multiple plug-ins. Lastly, if the browser does not support either 2 a paragraph element was embedded, so it can let the user know that "No embedded audio is supported". -->
